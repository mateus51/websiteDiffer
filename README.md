# websiteDiffer - An Amazing Project
Checks to see if my Software Engineering professor updated any grades.

This was coded using *Python 3*, so you might wanna update yours before running this.

## How to use
Just run _python3 main.py_ on the terminal, and watch as magic unfolds.
You may not have a file called _original_data.json_, which means that you don't have anything to
compare newer data to. In this case, if you wanna try, I uploaded one so you can try the program and see if 
there are any changes.
